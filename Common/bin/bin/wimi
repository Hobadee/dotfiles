# Following doesn't appear to work anymore:
#dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

# Google's version still works and shows both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
IPV4=$(dig -4 TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com)
IPV6=$(dig -6 TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com)

echo "IPv4: $IPV4"
echo "IPv6: $IPV6"
